# Features
- Follows the latest Material Design guidelines from Google.
- A very efficient way to create a tutorial. You just need to extend one class!
- Possibility for every user-created fragment to implement the CustomAction interface for providing custom actions in your tutorial (via Uris).
- Powerful built-it Fragment (TutorialFragment) included in the library for easily creating material-styled tutorial slides. The TutorialFragment supports user-defined CustomActions, animated images (AnimationDrawable) and has 3 different layers for creating a parallax effect in your tutorial!
- A basic but nice PageIndicator you can use outside of the tutorial.
